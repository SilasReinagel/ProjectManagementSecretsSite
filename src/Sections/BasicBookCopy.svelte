    I have worked in the software industry for over 16 years and managed over 200 projects. 
      I have distilled my key project management techniques into this short book. 
      These techniques work no matter what type of project you are on. I have experience managing 
      projects in a variety of industries: cryptocurrency,
      eCommerce, medical manufacturing, automated stock trading, and video games, just to name a few.

    In this book, you will learn all of the important techniques and paradigms that you would learn from a $3000 PMP Certification Course, but for a fraction of the price and without any of the useless academic fluff they throw in that has nothing to do with real-world projects.

    <h3>Reviewer Thoughts:</h3>

    "Iâ€™ve been reading PM books, taking some courses since 2010 and your book is pure gold, many other courses/books just want you to pay for a certificate when done with the book, the most disappointing is that those diplomas are just a piece of paper or a PDF. Skills in real life matter!" - Raul Martinez (Twitter @LabsSkull)
